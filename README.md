# wrapification

This is a little sample directive that I made for my talk hosted by [Cloudspace](https://github.com/cloudspace), which you can watch view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBxhJwFpHyY).

My intention was to show a simple way to create directives for misc. javascript libraries which don't already have an angular port/equivalent.

If you have any questions, hit me up and I'd love to help you out however I can!
